## Introduction

This is the first time I've tried a CTF with a time limit; unfortunately, I started on the last day, so I couldn't try all of the challenges. Regardless, this challenge was fun as it forced me to do a code review to understand the issue fully.


## BlackBox approach

### First Glance
When going to the target site I got an option to either `Signup, Login, or Forgot Password`

![signup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94e000a7-f776-420c-9750-6c69820427a6){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 1***

Since I don't have an account yet, I signed up first. And after I logged in using  the account I created I was taken to a page that has a bunch of different images.

![images](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3c09b74-b4bb-4ce5-9acc-7b4067b116f8){: width="500" height="400" .shadow}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 2***

Clicking directly on an image redirects me to a page of the image I clicked. But for the last(10th) image I got an error saying: `Only Admins can access Ben10!`

![onlyadminscanaccess](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3e0cc1e-78bd-4884-b312-ebbc8e2a57b3){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 3***

**With this I assumed that I needed to takeover an admin account named `admin` and that the 10th image would give me the flag.**

### Signing up with admin username

But there is no need for a takeover if we can just sign up as an admin right?
So I tried to sign up using `admin` as a `username` but had no luck, so I moved to another feature.

![idontlikeadmins](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf394a6-463c-42e9-ab47-dd85c1335edc){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 4***

### Forgot Password

Trying this feature immediately gives a red flag. It gives us a reset token after giving a `username` I want to recover

![tokengenerated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8231637d-51e4-4668-91d5-96fbcd9561a9){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 5***

Then clicking the `Reset your password` redirects me to a page that asks for a `Username` and a `New Password` 

#### How it works?
1.  Asks for a `username`
2. Gives a `reset token`
3. Asks again for a `username` and a `new password`


This was a good indicator for me since it means that I can change whose `password` I want to change by giving a `username` I don't own in the last step.

So I did...

![adminnotfound](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eaabb4a-ccd1-49e7-a3dd-85164cb05521){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 6***

What a bummer! I thought it was going to be easy XD

At least this tells me that it's either there's no username `admin` or the system just gives this response instead of a `403` to mislead players :P

So to test my theory I created a new user and tried to change its password using the `Forgot Password` feature

![invalidusertoken](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7a54562-c003-4712-9133-9e9850b00a62){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 7***

Welp, it seems that there's a permission check...with this I assumed that we can't use a different username for the first and third step because of the permission check and that the `admin` username doesn't exist since we didn't get a `user not found` error.
But, we are sure that there's an `admin` because of the error we got from trying to access the 10th image (***Figure 3***) And the flow is still sketchy to me...

Since we were given a source code my next idea is that maybe the `admin username` is being leaked there.

## WhiteBox approach

### Looking for the Admin username

Actually, the reason why I tried doing a `Blackbox` approach first is because I was scared to look at the source code because I'm not really good at doing code reviews XD

Continuing...

The first thing I did was to see if the `admin username` is being leaked somewhere in the code, and it didn't take a lot of time to find it. When I looked at `home.html` there it was the `secret admin username`

```html
    <div style="display:none;" id="admin_data"> {admin_username} </div>
```

So I checked the page source back in the target site and finally

```html
<h1> Welcome, dats</h1>
<h2> Do you like the aliens on my Omnitrix?</h2>

<!-- secret admin username -->
 <div style="=display:none;" id="admin_data">admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26</div>
 ```

 so we now have the `admin username` --> `admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26`. The next step is going to be the last right? I can just request a `reset token` using the `admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26` username and we're done, right??? ~~Goodnight and 8 hours of sleep let's go :)~~

 Yeah...no!!!

 ![admincantreqforgotpass](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d91bce3-b3db-44a0-b49e-28dc8d44631c){: width="500" height="400"}

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  ***Figure 8***

At this point, I just said to myself that I have the code so I should just find the issue in the code so I don't waste more time XD

### App.py

Since I'm quite familiar with Python understanding the code was manageable(thankfully)

I started at the top instead of directly going to the function where the `resetting of password` is happening. This is because I thought it would be good practice for me to read and understand the code that others wrote :D

I immediately saw the reason why I was getting the errors before

#### /register (shortened code)

```python
if username.startswith('admin') or '^' in username:
    flash("I don't like admins", "error")
    return render_template('register.html')
```
#### /reset_password (shortened code)

```python
if username.startswith('admin'):
    flash("Admin users cannot request a reset token.", "error")
    return render_template('reset_password.html')
```

It checks if the input we give starts with `"admin"` if it is then it will trigger the error.

#### /forgot_password (shortened code)

Please check the `comments` in the code for the explanation :)

```python
# It checks if the username doesn't start with admin
if not username.startswith('admin'):
    token = get_reset_token_for_user(username) # username = request.form['username']

    # If TRUE it checks if the reset_token is valid and will be used for the inputted username
    if token and token[0] == reset_token: # reset_token = request.form['reset_token']

        # If TRUE then it proceeds to reset the password of the variable username
        update_password(username, new_password)
        flash(f"Password reset successfully.", "success")
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    # If FALSE then it gives out an error "Invalid reset token for user."
    else:
        flash("Invalid reset token for user.", "error")

# If however the username starts with admin
else:
    # It splits the username using `^` as a separator
    # Then it gets the second index [1] of the array. Note: the first index is [0]
    username = username.split('^')[1]
    token = get_reset_token_for_user(username)
    # Then it checks if the reset_token is valid and will be used for the inputted username
    if token and token[0] == reset_token:

        # If TRUE then it proceeds to reset the password however...
        # IMPORTANT: instead of using "username" it uses "request.form['username']"
        # This means that the code will change the password of the unsplit username
        update_password(request.form['username'], new_password)
        flash(f"Password reset successfully.", "success")
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    else:
        flash("Invalid reset token for user.", "error")
```

It might seem confusing so I'll try to show what's going to happen clearly.

#### Code Flow

##### Remember: How does `Forgot Password` work?
1.  Asks for a `username`
2. Gives a `reset token`
3. Asks again for a `username` and a `new password`

**REMINDER!!! We are already in the third step here(`/reset_password` is responsible for the first and second step)**

Let's say that we used `dats` in the first step and `admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26` for the third step

```python
    else:
        # admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26 --> dats
        username = username.split('^')[1] 
        token = get_reset_token_for_user(username)

        # True since the username is now dats and we used dats in the first step
        if token and token[0] == reset_token:
            
            # Instead of using the updated value of the username variable --> "dats"
            # It uses the value I gave in the third step --> "admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26"
            update_password(request.form['username'], new_password)

            # And this results in the system changing 
            # The password of the admin instead of my account :P
            
            flash(f"Password reset successfully.", "success")
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

## Solution

All in all, to takeover the account of the `admin`  all we need to do is:

1. Leak the `username` of the `admin` in our case it's --> `admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26`
2. Request for a `reset token` using a `username` we own --> `dats`
3. Get the `reset token` and proceed to the next page
4. Use `admin^dats^1c4cdf3c26` in the `username form`
5. Login using the new credentials of the `admin` and check the 10th image.

## Lessons Learned

* Always doubt your assumptions. Because I wasn't able to change the password of my second account, I assumed that the permission check was there, not thinking to double-check with the username of the admin when I found it. If I did, then I would have already solved the challenge without even looking at the code.

    It's still a win though since I got out of my comfort zone. But in the wild, where we normally don't have the source code handed to us. Doubting our assumptions is definitely beneficial :D

* The result of reviewing the code was better than I expected. At first, I thought there was no way that I would understand what it was doing but thankfully most of the lines are pretty self-explanatory, and with a little bit ~~(a lot)~~ of Googling, I was able to understand how it was working.

    * For example, I had no idea at first what the method `split` was doing, so I tried it myself and figured out that it separates the string based on what the separator is and puts them in an array

        ```python
        >>> username = "ttt^ggg^sss"
        >>> username = username.split("^")
        >>> username[1]
        'ggg'
        >>> username[2]
        'sss'
        >>> username[3]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        IndexError: list index out of range ## I was even reminded that the index starts in [0] lol
        >>> username[0]
        'ttt'
        >>>
        ```

Thanks to the Sardinia Len team for creating the CTF.

I hope you enjoyed this write-up. Thanks for reading and have a nice day :D
